## Opal Documentation

_Opal is a full stack framework that makes building digital tools for health care easy._

Opal builds deep clinical domain specific functionality on top of
[Django](https://djangoproject.com/), [Angular](https://angularjs.org/)
and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to help developers quickly build easy to maintain,
robust clinical applications.

This is the **developer documentation**.

Opal is an entirely open [source](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal),
open [governance](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal/issues) product.

### First Steps

If you're new to Opal, then you'll want to take a look at the
[Installation instructions](installation.md), and then maybe take the
[tutorial](tutorial.md).

### Full documentation

While [Topic guides](guides/topic-guides.md) are available for many key areas of Opal,
the [Detailed reference material](reference/reference_guides.md) is a work in progress.

If you find any issues or missing areas of this documentation, please do raise it with the
team on the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal/issues).
